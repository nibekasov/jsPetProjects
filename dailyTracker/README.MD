What is this project?

This project is web application for my needs, to track development og my personality and my skills. 
It is needed to track my grouth and help me to achive my goals. 


Plan of my project:


Sure, I can help you outline a plan for your JavaScript project that tracks your daily routine, stores activities on Hyperskill, SQL, LeetCode, and supports manual entry as well as integration with Google Fit API. Here's a step-by-step plan:

Project Overview and Goals:

Define the scope of the project: What features do you want in the app? (e.g., tracking activities, storing data, integration with Google Fit, manual entry)
Identify the technologies you'll use: JavaScript (Node.js for backend, React for frontend), SQL for data storage, and Google Fit API for fitness data.
Set Up the Project:

Create a new Node.js project: Set up a directory structure for your project.
Initialize a Git repository for version control.
User Interface (Frontend):

Design the user interface: Create wireframes/mockups of how the app will look.
Use React (or any preferred frontend framework) to create the UI components.
Implement pages for viewing and adding activities, connecting with Google Fit, and managing manual entries.
Backend Development:

Create RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on activities.
Set up a database using SQL (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store activity data.
Implement API endpoints for managing manual entries and connecting with Google Fit.
Authentication and User Management:

Implement user authentication and registration functionality.
Secure API endpoints to ensure only authenticated users can access certain features.
Integration with Google Fit:

Use the Google Fit API to fetch fitness data (step count, activities) for the user.
Store this data in your database or display it directly in the app.
Activity Tracking and Storage:

Implement features to track your daily activities manually through the UI.
Store these activities in the database, associated with the user.
Integration with Hyperskill, SQL, and LeetCode:

Define the structure for storing data related to these platforms (e.g., store links, completion status, progress).
Create API endpoints or data models to handle this data.
Implement functionality to view and update your progress on Hyperskill, SQL, and LeetCode.
Testing:

Write unit tests for your backend API endpoints and any complex frontend logic.
Test the integration with Google Fit and other APIs.
Deployment:

Deploy your backend (Node.js server) and database to a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean).
Deploy your frontend (React app) to a suitable hosting platform.
Documentation and User Guide:

Write clear documentation on how to use the app, including Google Fit integration.
Provide instructions for setting up the project locally.
Create a user guide explaining the app's features.
Review and Refine:

Test the app thoroughly in a real-world scenario.
Gather feedback from users and make necessary improvements.
Make sure the app is user-friendly and meets your goals.
Future Enhancements:

Consider additional features such as data visualization, goal setting, notifications, etc.
This plan provides a comprehensive outline for your project. You can break down each step further into smaller tasks and prioritize them based on your preferences and timeline. Happy coding!
